Features I implemented:
1)I implemented a search function.
2)I implemented a statistics function.

Things I learnt from the assignment:
1) TypeScript is very different from JavaScript, although there are similarities.
2) Making a task tracker takes time and knowledge.

Challenges I faced during implementation:
1) The manual was a bit hard to read, so I repeated a couple of lines of code to fix an error.
2) I got errors trying to make the typescript understand the variable type.
